### 5 App Ideas



* Location-based ads
  *  When you walk by a certain location the location will pop up on your phone, indicating things like discounts for stores.

* Location-based stories
  *  Plop down stories on locations and when friends walk by them they play instantaneously.

* Bump into people
  *  Have a navigational turn-by-turn map that directs you on a path to your destination like Google Maps but allows you to bump into people or things of interest on the way

* Location-based reminders
  *  Similar to time-based reminders except based on location - when you near a certain place the reminder will occur.
    
* Discover weekly for Yelp
  *  Discover local outings for you and your friends on a map.
