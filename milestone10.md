## Milestone 10

### What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.

We're trying to make creating and sharing event maps easy for event organizers and improve attendees' ability to navigate event venues with our maps

### How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?

Event maps are often just listed as directories or images on a site and offer no orientational information, leading to users being confused and having difficulty navigation. Existing solutions like Guidebook, marketed as entire event planning applications, require copious amounts of event metadata bundled with limited maps functionality.

### What's new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?

Our approach involves allowing event planners to create maps through outlining their event boundaries and points of interest directly on maps (and possibly overlaying images as a stretch goal). When translated to viewable maps, this allows event attendees to orient themselves and navigate venues better than with paper or image maps.

### Who cares? If you're successful, what difference will it make?

Event planners will experience a more fluid experience in building interactive maps for event attendees, while event attendees will be able to use our maps to better navigate event venues and orient themselves.

From personal experience, having experienced the trouble of organizing SD Hacks and observing many questions at the help desk ("Where is the Green Room [in Rimac]?"), Guorient's interactive maps would allow attendees to more easily find and navigate venues, freeing up organizers' time.
